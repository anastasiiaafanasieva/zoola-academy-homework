# Task 3: Use your imagination

While searching for some interesting commands and doing research I found out a game related to Git and I think it's worth sharing:) Work hard, play hard!

**[Git Game v.1](https://github.com/git-game/git-game)**

**[Git Game v.2](https://github.com/git-game/git-game-v2)**

The Game has 10 levels and all tasks you need to do using Terminal. It's caught my mind, tasks are interesting and make you Google a lot:)
For example, you need to find a commit hash number by the message of commit, to find a branch with the bug (using `git bisect`), checkout to the branch which name is the answer for the riddle, etc.

**Highly recommended:)**
